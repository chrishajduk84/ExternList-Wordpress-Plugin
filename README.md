# ExternList-Wordpress-Plugin
Shortcode implementation of a external file parsing plugin. This allows the plugin to grab data from external websites and include it within a wordpress page of the site. This plugin was built for openhardware.science, to create a list of projects/residencies, curated by a public git repository.
